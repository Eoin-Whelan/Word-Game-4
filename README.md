# Word-Game-4
Python project built with the Anvil web platform. A basic word game that scrapes the data from a Google drive text file that acts as a dictionary. A random eight letter word is selected from that dictionary and the user must make seven words from the random word. App also displays a top ten leaderboard and user log function.

If you'd like to import this to your own Anvil account, you'll need the [hash URL routing dependency](https://github.com/s-cork/HashRouting) as a project in your Anvil account. I've also provided a clone link for that project below but I recommend checking out the documentation before working with this project.
